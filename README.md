I'm an aspiring Full-Stack web developer with training from the University of Arizona's coding bootcamp. I'm well versed in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Node.js.

I've always had an interest in technology and all things nerdy, and I'm excited to not only learn how it all works, but begin building applications myself.

I have a keen eye for aesthetics and fine details, and have always been driven by challenge and my nerdy passions.
